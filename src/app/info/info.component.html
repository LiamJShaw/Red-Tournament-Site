<h2>Format</h2>
<p>This year, we’ll be using a Swiss-style bracket. Unlike previous years, there will be a <strong>one-round seeding round</strong> followed by <strong>three rounds of Swiss</strong>. All competitors will play at least <strong>four races</strong> throughout their tournament run.</p>
<p>In the Swiss rounds, competitors will be <strong>divided into three brackets</strong> and only race against others in the same bracket. Winners will be promoted to the next bracket, while losers will be demoted.</p>
<p>After the four rounds, the top 9 players will compete in a single-elimination winner-takes-all bracket consisting of the <strong>semifinals</strong> and <strong>finals</strong>.</p>

<h2>Seeding</h2>
<p>The seeding round will operate as follows: prior to the tournament, the organizers will seed players into one of three pots - <strong>pot 1, pot 2, and pot 3</strong>.</p>
<p>The seeding round draw will draw one player from <strong>each of the pots</strong>, which will form a race. <strong>Byes due to bracket imbalances</strong> will be assigned pot 2 status.</p>

<p>The results of the seeding round will determine each competitor’s starting bracket in the Swiss rounds: <strong>winners</strong> advance to the <strong>high bracket</strong>, <strong>losers</strong> to the <strong>low bracket</strong>, and <strong>remaining competitors</strong> to the <strong>middle bracket</strong>.</p>


<h2>Swiss Rounds</h2>
<p>Each round of Swiss will see all competitors be matched in a 3-player race with other competitors from their same bracket. There may be some 2-player races possible due to bracket imbalances.</p>
<p>In Swiss Rounds 2 and 3, we will organize players into pots based on their points and tiebreaker value. Before each race, each competitor accrues points based on their bracket as indicated below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>High Bracket</strong>: 3 points</li>
  <li><strong>Middle Bracket</strong>: 1 point</li>
  <li><strong>Low Bracket</strong>: 0 points</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Winning a race grants 4 points</strong>. Coming in any other place grants 0 points.</p>
<p>Race placement determines the player’s status for the next Swiss round</p>
<p>In 3-player races, the first-place finisher is promoted to the high bracket, and the last-place finisher is demoted to the low bracket. The remaining player stays in their current bracket.</p>

<p><i>* Only applies to 2nd place in 3-player races.</i></p>

<h2>Tiebreaker Criteria</h2>
<p>Tiebreaker values will be assigned based on total points accrued from bracket standings.</p>
<p>Wins do not contribute to the tiebreaker value. If a player has any DNFs in Swiss rounds, their tiebreaker value is -1.</p>
<p>We hope that with these tiebreaker values, players are more incentivized to finish their races.</p>

<h2>Top Cut</h2>
<p>After the Swiss rounds, the top 9 players will advance to three semifinal matches, with the winners moving on to the grand finals. Players will be ordered by points and then by tiebreaker value, and assigned to pots based on their standings.</p>
