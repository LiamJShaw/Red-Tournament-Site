<h1 class="mb-4">Tournament Rules</h1>

<h2>Setting up</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Download <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e_pUcq5JcJkLql5j2EsNO7yng-aop39D/view?usp=sharing">portable OBS</a>.</li>
  <li>Unzip the file and run the <strong>RED RUNNER OBS LAUNCH.bat</strong> file to open OBS. This will contain the layout required if your race is being restreamed.</li>
  <li>The restreamer will provide you with the <strong>server URL</strong> to stream to. Unless stated otherwise, you will <strong>NOT</strong> be streaming on your own channel for the race.</li>
  <li>Join the <span class="badge discord-blue p-2"><a class="text-light text-decoration-none" href="https://discord.com/channels/456193501852467222/1286753245741580431">Tournament Waiting Room</a></span> voice channel <strong>15-20 minutes</strong> before your race to set up your stream. This process is mandatory unless stated otherwise.</li>
  <li>All racers must join the <a href="https://racetime.gg">RaceTime</a> channel created by the admins or commentators for race tracking and communication.</li>
  <li>Streams must be live at least <strong>5 minutes</strong> before the race starts.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to the <a href="https://racetime.gg">RaceTime.gg</a> race window, especially before the race starts and during the first few minutes, as it is the primary form of communication between you and the restreamer/commentators.</li>
  <li>Commentators/restreamers will communicate with you to set an initial game palette before the race begins. This is a countermeasure against pre-recorded runs. They should specify this in the form of a direction + optional button, e.g., <code class="text-primary"><strong>LEFT+A</strong></code> or <code class="text-primary"><strong>UP</strong></code>. <strong>Make sure you set this palette and are using it when you begin the race.</strong></li>
  <li>You may also be asked to do other actions at the discretion of the commentators if there is suspicion that your run may be pre-recorded.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Post-Race</h2>
<ul>
  <li>After you finish your race, if you would like to join the stream for a <strong>post-race interview</strong>, please join the <span class="badge discord-blue p-2"><a class="text-light text-decoration-none" href="https://discord.com/channels/456193501852467222/1286753245741580431">Tournament Waiting Room</a></span> voice channel. Someone will then pull you into the restream/commentary channel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The run has to follow the <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnrbext?h=Any_Glitchless_No_Instant_Text&rules=game&x=7dg6p5gk">Game</a> and <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnrbext?h=Any_Glitchless_No_Instant_Text&rules=category&x=7dg6p5gk">Category</a> rules from Speedrun.com.</li>
    <li>Instant Text (IT) is banned from the tournament. In the event that you mistakenly get IT, it has to be killed off <strong>before the first turn on Bridge Rival</strong> and <strong>before the first turn on Dig Rocket</strong> respectively. Otherwise, you will be issued a <strong>3 minute penalty</strong>.</li>
    <li>Runs longer than <strong>2h30m</strong> count as "Did Not Finish" (DNF) to keep on track with restreaming time slots.</li>
    <li>In the unlikely event of a tie that ends up mattering for advancement or seeding, each run in question will be frame counted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Crashes/Disconnects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the event that a racer’s stream disconnects for an extended period of time, they will have to provide a VOD of the run to the admins for review.</li>
  <li>If a racer’s console/emulator crashes, they must continue from their last save.</li>
  <li>If a racer’s console/emulator crashes within the first 20 minutes, a rematch is allowed ONLY if all racers agree.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggestions/Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have a <a href="https://racetime.gg">Racetime.gg</a> and know how it works.</li>
